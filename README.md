# scATAC-seq Data Analysis Tutorial

For this example we’ll be working with the 10X PBMC datasets that contain ~10K cells for both scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq.

This repository contains the pre-processing and analysis steps for scATAC-seq data as well as integration of scATAC-seq data with scRNA-seq data.

Please note this tutorial borrows heavily from Seurat’s tutorials (https://satijalab.org/seurat/vignettes.html), so feel free to go through them in more detail.

The repository has scATAC_seq.R (a R script for the analysis of scATAC-seq data and integration of scATAC-seq with scRNA-seq data). 

The original data (atac_v1_pbmc_10k) is freely avaialble from 10X Genomics website.

The Rscript has all the processes and steps defined with a "#", for the user's convenience. 

All the image files (heatmaps, plots, and others) generated from the R script have been provided here.
